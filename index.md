##Let's learn GitHub

Posting the presentation soon...

##Let's Practice

* Fork the repo
* Create a new branch, name it whatever you want
* Find the file with your number.
* Add a header titled "Hello, world!" In that section, share your name (or GitHub username) and your favorite animal.
* Add a header titled "My Thoughts on Government" In that section, tell us about your favorite government agency or service and why you love it. Then, tell us about your least favorite government agency or service and one way (big or small) that you would fix it if you were in control. Be creative!
* Submit a pull request.
